# .NET-Design-Patterns-Examples
An educational project where all .NET OOP design patterns are implemented with given examples.
> :warning: **Bad practise alert**: A lot of public fields in the repository examples. In real projects use encapsulation and always think how to expose your data.

## SOLID Design Principles
## Creational
- Builder
> **When constructing objects gets a little bit complicated.** Some objects are simple and can be created with a simple constructor call. Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create. Having a constructor with 10 constructor arguments is not productive. 
- Factories
  * Abstract Factory
  > **The purpose of the Abstract Factory is to provide an interface for creating families of related objects, without specifying concrete classes.**
  * Factory Method
  > Creating an object in one invocation same as Builder but the act of **creating object is outsourced from the actual object to something else like separate function 
   or a separate class (Factory)**
